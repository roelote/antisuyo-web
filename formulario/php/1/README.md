==============================
Create a filtered image gallery by category by reading image files from folders or sub-directories and creating their corresponding thumbnails automatically using php.

For further reference read the original tutorial [here](http://www.picssel.com/create-a-filtered-image-gallery-with-jquery-and-fancybox-part-2-create-image-thumbnails-with-php/).

**Important** : This code  relies on the proper implementation of the [Fancybox &copy;](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) jQuery plugin.
